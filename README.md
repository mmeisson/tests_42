# DISCLAIMER

Ces tests ne valent pas plus que le credit que vous leur apporterez.



### HOW TO

It depends. When there is a Makefile, you will often have to move the entire folder in the directory where the project you want to test is. Some repo just contain some guideline, some just some file ( to use as input ? )

Makefiles are often writed in order to work with my own projects. You could have to change some PATHs ( mainly variables INCS_PATH which contains directory where you put your headers )

There should not be any test on undefined behaviors, since it is stupid to test a behavior when you don't have any.


### Notes

Notes, guidelines and co just reflets author's opinion when writed, nothing else.

He may even broke himself some things written there
